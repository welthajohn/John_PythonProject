Hi ,
Here I have Created a Survival Duration Calculator using Python where you can calculate how long a person can lived in various time unit such as Second,Minutes,Hours ,Days,weeks.
This Code allows the user to Enter his age and then Various time Unit ,if we enter an Invalid input then it shows an Error.

First I have Created a Class name SurvivalDurationCalculator ,where I have Create an  constructor and given a parameter Age,After then I have Created Method and naming it calculate_Survivalduration which will calculate the life Duration According to The Input pass by User,then I have mentioned some Conditional Statements using if ,elif,else ,In this If ,elif,else,I have kept a string method lower() which will convert upper case into Lower case if the Input enters an UpperCase value...Then I have Calculate age with number of seconds,Months,Hours,Days,Minutes in a year and also mentioned a else statements which will be show an error if the Input enters an Invalid Value.

I have mentioned an Input Function for User to enter his Age and Unit then I have Created a Instance  of SurvivalDurationCalculator class with user's Age.I have created variable duration  which calls the calculate_Survivalduration method on the calculator instance which will have a selected Unit,Then I mentioned Control flow statement with  isinstance which will check whether the enter duration Value is a Integer and if the Value enter is not Integer it will show error .


Thank you_
